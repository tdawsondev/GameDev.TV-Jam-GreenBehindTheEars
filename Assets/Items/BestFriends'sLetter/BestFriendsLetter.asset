  description: "\u201CDear Winter, I am moving away. Aaron got a job opportunity,
    and we\u2019re leaving together. I\u2019m sorry, but please don\u2019t try to
    find us. I care about you deeply, and you were a wonderful friend, but the last
    few years have been really difficult for me. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t
    live your life for you and live mine at the same time. So, this is goodbye. I
    wish you all the best, I hope you can forgive me. - Mary\u201D"
