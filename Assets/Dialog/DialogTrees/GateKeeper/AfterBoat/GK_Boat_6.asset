  dialogText: The nature of my being here is in effect rather complex, and intricately
    woven with yours. But it is not yet the time to explain it, as it would be difficult
    for you to understand. Say, why not go over to your house? I do believe that
    once you are settled in a little, it might be a tad easier for you to process
    it all.
